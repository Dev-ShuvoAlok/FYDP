# Final Year Design Project

## Introduction
This is the topic of Final year design project of B.Sc program in CSE. Though during the final defence, it was a very poor performance. 
But all i wish to do a  bettter work to publish in a conference. And finally after almost 6 month of hard work, i came to improve the model and achived better result.
And Finally my paper [Facial Emotion Recognition by Ensemble-DenseNet Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10461880/authors#authors) Published in 
2023 IEEE R10 HTC. You can Download and Read the paper free from [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379106612_Facial_Emotion_Recognition_by_Ensemble-DenseNet_Networks) 

Thanks to my mentors(Huda Sir,Jalal Bhai) and my friend (S.M.Badhon)  & family for Unconditional Support.

## What we have done here
- have solved multi-class classification
- using  deep-leraning technique fro image processing
- build and noble ensemble model using 3 pre-trained version of DenseNet model
- Achived an accuracy of 74.16% on test data
- Recognized emotion from facial expression accurately

## What can be useful for you
- Can be used for any type of further multi-class classification
- can learn about how to use pre-trained model for image classification
- will be able to build up new ensemble model

  ***Thanks For The Read***
